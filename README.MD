# Teaching and Learning for Librarians

This repository is a testing sand-box for a project I aim to deliver as part of a Teaching and Learning for Librarians course I am currently undetaking. 

The aim of the project is to develop an online/blended learning/teaching tool for introducing people to the International Image Interoperability Framepwork (IIIF) and using it to interact and work with the digitised collections of, amongst others, Cambridge Digital Library.
